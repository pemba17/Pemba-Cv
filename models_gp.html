<p>Before few months ago I had no idea about web development like HTML,CSS. I used to know little about html but CSS was completely new to me. Later on when I started to learn about CSS I found it more interesting .When I used to use HTML the page were not attractive but after using CSS properties the page were looking beautiful and attractive. CSS is used to define styles for web pages, including the design, layout and variations in display for different devices. To attract the people towards our page a website requires a good animation, transition, mobile responsive etc. Now days due to rapid growth of technology we find that there are more mobile users than the computer users. Mobile responsive is used to make web page look good on mobile devices. After learning about mobile responsive now every website looks attractive either on portable devices or personal computers. So I find web development more interesting and I learn through many websites like w3schools, treehouse which helped me a lot of upgrade myself in web development. During our first term we learn about HTML, CSS and their properties. We were given a assignment to develop a CV website using HTML and CSS(Cascading Style Sheets). After the completion of my assignment I had a great experience on web development. I knew more about media queries, responsive animation transition which helps to make design, layout of page look more attractive. Finally I also knew about the importance of CSS in web development and if we keep researching about web development it makes it more and more interesting to learn about web development.</p><br>
